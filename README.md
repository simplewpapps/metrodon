# Metrodon
Metrodon is an unofficial, open-source Mastodon instances reader.


[![Get Metrodon from Live Store](https://edge.live.net.co/images/store/2025_GetButton_SmallBlack.png)](https://store.live.net.co/app/324)

# Functionality
Metrodon can read and show posts and trending hashtags. You can change the instance to any EXCEPT mastodon.social, probably because it already requires TLS 1.3 but HttpClient in WinRT has only TLS 1.2. You need to type a weblink like mas.to or social.vivaldi.net.
